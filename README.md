## Demonstration of using google maps in react via [@react-google-maps/api]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-google-maps/api)
Am learning how to work with google maps in react. THis example works and is easy to implement. However there is a definite performance issue for dynamically adding markers or other content to the map. Am leaving this here for reference, however am going to either reimplement or rewrite to avoid rerendering on each map click for adding new markers.
